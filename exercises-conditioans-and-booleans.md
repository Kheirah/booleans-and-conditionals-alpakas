# Exercises conditionals & booleans

Use this function as starting point for your exercise.

```js
let loggedInUser = "Mr. JS";

if (loggedInUser === "something") {
  //your badass code
}
```

You can run your code by entering the following command in the terminal:

```sh
node index.js
```

Complete the function `outputMessage` with the following exercises:

1. Add an `if-statement` to the function which checks if a string passed in via parameter contains the word `student` and logs out _"Welcome student!"_ to the console.
2. Extend the above statement and add an `else`-clause which logs out _"Welcome stranger! May the force be with you."_ if the parameter does not contain the word `student`.
3. Extend your condition expression in this statement so that the given string may also contain `Coach`. Use this variable to construct a "Welcome"-text for your log output.
4. Transform the decision logic above with the use of a _ternary operator._
5. Write a `case-statement` equivalent.
